            <ul>
                <li>It is supposed that the famous ship sailed by the hero Theseus in a great battle was kept in a
                    harbor as a museum piece.</li>
                <li> and as the years went by some of the wooden parts began to rot and were
                    replaced by new ones; then, after a century or so, every part had been replaced. </li>
                <li>The question then
                    is if the "restored" ship is still the same object as the original?</li>

                <li>If it is, then suppose the removed pieces were stored in a warehouse, and after the century,
                    technology was developed that cured their rot and enabled them to be reassembled into a ship? </li>
                <li> Is this "reconstructed" ship the original ship?</li>
                <li>If it is, then what about the restored ship in the
                    harbor still being the original ship as well?</li>
            </ul>
